# Autonomous Strategies

This folder contains example autonomous strategies aimed at maximizing points in competition.
Each strategy includes a brief description and a Python file that modifies
`state_machine/version2.py` to implement the approach.

The examples are intentionally simple so you can adapt them to your own robot.
