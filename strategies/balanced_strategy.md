# Balanced Strategy

This approach mixes offensive scoring with periodic defensive maneuvers.

## Key Tactics

- **Moderate Scan Speed** – search for targets while staying aware of opponents.
- **Controlled Approach** – drive forward at a steady pace to maintain accuracy.
- **Short Attack Cycle** – limit the arm motion so the robot can quickly return to a neutral position.

These parameters sit close to the equilibrium point, providing adaptability against various opponents.
