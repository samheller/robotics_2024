# Defensive Strategy

The defensive approach focuses on blocking opponents and preventing them from scoring.

## Key Tactics

- **Slow Scan** – rotate carefully to keep the robot oriented toward incoming opponents.
- **Maintain Distance** – approach only far enough to block or push objects away.
- **Quick Retreat** – back up after each interaction to reset your position.

Use this strategy when protecting your scoring zones is more important than fast offense.
