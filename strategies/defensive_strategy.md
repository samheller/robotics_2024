# Defensive Strategy

The defensive approach focuses on blocking opponents and preventing them from scoring.

## Key Tactics

- **Slow Scan** – rotate carefully to keep the robot oriented toward incoming opponents.
- **Maintain Distance** – approach only far enough to block or push objects away.
- **Quick Retreat** – back up after each interaction to reset your position.

Use this strategy when protecting your scoring zones is more important than fast offense.

## State Flow

1. **Manual** – the driver positions the robot.
2. **Scanning** – slow rotation to keep the front facing opponents.
3. **Aligning** – minimal turn to square up for a block.
4. **Approaching** – move forward just enough to interfere.
5. **Attacking** – brief arm motion to push objects away.
6. **Retreating** – back off to reset the blocking position.
