# Equilibrium Strategy

This approach aims to balance offensive and defensive actions by adopting
tactic values that form a Nash equilibrium among scan speed, drive velocity
and attack duration.

## Key Tactics

- **Standard Scan** – maintain a moderate scan speed so targets are found
  without overshooting defensive positioning.
- **Adaptive Approach** – drive at an average speed to stay accurate while
  keeping pressure on opponents.
- **Timed Attack** – hold the arm action for just long enough to score but
  not so long that recovery is delayed.

Use this strategy when you expect opponents to respond with equally mixed
offensive and defensive moves.
