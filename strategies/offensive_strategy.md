# Offensive Strategy

The offensive approach focuses on rapid target acquisition and aggressive scoring.

## Key Tactics

- **Fast Scan** – rotate quickly at the start to locate scoring objects.
- **Direct Approach** – drive at high speed once a target is detected.
- **Extended Attack** – run the arm mechanism longer to ensure the object is scored.

This strategy trades precision for speed. Tune the velocities based on how much
room you have on the field.

## State Flow

1. **Manual** – regular driver control.
2. **Scanning** – quick spin to find a scoring object.
3. **Aligning** – rapid turn to point directly at the target.
4. **Approaching** – drive forward at high speed until close.
5. **Attacking** – extended arm motion to ensure a score.
6. **Retreating** – reverse away before returning to manual mode.
