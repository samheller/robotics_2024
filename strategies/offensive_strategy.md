# Offensive Strategy

The offensive approach focuses on rapid target acquisition and aggressive scoring.

## Key Tactics

- **Fast Scan** – rotate quickly at the start to locate scoring objects.
- **Direct Approach** – drive at high speed once a target is detected.
- **Extended Attack** – run the arm mechanism longer to ensure the object is scored.

This strategy pushes beyond the equilibrium values to maximize short-term points
at the risk of leaving the robot exposed.
